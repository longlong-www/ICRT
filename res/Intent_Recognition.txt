 
You are an expert in prompt parsing. Analyze the given sentence and extract two components: 
﻿ 
1. “structural_intent”: the core malicious goal or target action (what to do).   
2. “harmful_behavior”: the operation or method by which it is carried out (how to do it). 
﻿ 
**Output requirements**   
- Respond **only** with a JSON object containing these two keys.   
- Do **not** output any extra text, explanation, or markdown.   
- Preserve verb tense and focus from the original input.   
- If no malicious intent is detected, return empty strings for both fields.
